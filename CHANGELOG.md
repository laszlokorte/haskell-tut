# Educational custom implementation of Haskell concepts

The point of this project was to manually implement many of the data types and 
type classes popular in the Haskell community and/or contained in the Haskell 
prelude for a better understanding of all the details.

Some of the type classes differ slightly from there usual implementation.

The `app/Main.hs` file is written to be read from top to bottom.

The laws for each type class that can not be expressed via Haskell itself
are not mentioned inside the code or the comments.
